# projectruin
A text-based game made in Python set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy universe.
Note that this game is being created in Python by three 15-year-old brothers with too much time on their hands,
so progress will be slow. Also, we're not quite sure how to use this site so bear with us as we find out how to 
untangle this mass of buttons they call GitHub.
Check out the wiki tab for updates and sneak peeks!

Thanks!
